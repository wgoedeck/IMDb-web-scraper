Some other times the movie is not listed at the IMDb site; this usually happens again with foreign films, with unmatched movie titles, e.g., when one title may be in English and the other in the host language of the country the movie was made at. I've found this movie rating algorithm to be at least 90% effective with foreign movies, and nearly 100% when rating English language films. \n",

    "Since the site works mostly with Criterion Channel movie selections, and most users would probably not be subscribers, I may change the output of movie results from the **criterion_list()** function to be stored as a file, and require the input of movie titles and corresponding release years to **selection_choice()** be read from a file rather than passing the list directly between functions. This would allow a file of movie titles and years composed by another method to be passed to the **selection_choice()** function. \n",
